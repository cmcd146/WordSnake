### WordSnake

WordSnake is a word game using vanilla javascript.  I tried to blend two classics, Snake and Crossword into a fun and challenging game that test a persons vocabulary and spelling skills.  

Initially a one week project, I plan to continue adding features as time goes on.

## Features

* Allows user to enter words and string them together.
* Using an API call, the word is checked and a strike is added if the word does not exist.
* Player can change direction on completion of word.
* Score is updated as words are completed.
* When the player reaches three strikes, the game is over.
